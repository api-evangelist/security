<p><strong>Session Management</strong> - API should pass session-based authentication, either by establishing a session token via a POST or by using an API key as a POST body argument or as a cookie, avoiding putting usernames, passwords, session tokens, and API keys in the URL, as this can be captured in web server logs, which makes them intrinsically valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Session State</strong> - Many web services are written to be as stateless as possible, usually ending up with a state blob being sent as part of the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-Farming</strong> - APIs are put up, and then farmed, such as a price matching website or aggregation service. There's no technical method of preventing this use, so strongly consider means to encourage it as a business model by making high velocity farming is possible for a fee, or contractually limiting service using terms and conditions. CAPTCHAs and similar methods can help reduce simpler adversaries, but not well funded or technically competent adversaries. Using mutually assured client side TLS certificates may be a method of limiting access to trusted organizations, but this is by no means certain, particularly if certificates are posted deliberately or by accident to the Internet.</p>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-empty.png" width="100" align="left" style="padding: 15px;" />
<p><strong>Protect HTTP Methods</strong> - APIs often use GET (read), POST (create), PUT (replace/update) and DELETE (to delete a record). Not all of these are valid choices for every single resource collection, user, or action. Make sure the incoming HTTP method is valid for the session token/API key and associated resource collection, action, and record. For example, if you have an RESTful API for a library, it's not okay to allow anonymous users to DELETE book catalog entries, but it's fine for them to GET a book catalog entry. On the other hand, for the librarian, both of these are valid uses.</p>

<p><strong>Methods Whitelist</strong> - It is common with RESTful services to allow multiple methods for a given URL for different operations on that entity. For example, a GET request might read the entity while PUT would update an existing entity, POST would create a new entity, and DELETE would delete an existing entity. It is important for the service to properly restrict the allowable verbs such that only the allowed verbs would work, while all others would return a proper response code (for example, a 403 Forbidden).</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery</strong> - For resources exposed by RESTful web services, it's important to make sure any PUT, POST, and DELETE request is protected from Cross Site Request Forgery. Typically one would use a token-based approach. See Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet for more information on how to implement CSRF-protection.</p>

<p><strong>Assist the User</strong> - Assisting the user makes the most sense, as the most common scenario is "problem exists between keyboard and computer" (PEBKAC). Help the user input high quality data into your web services, such as ensuring a Zip code makes sense for the supplied address, or the date makes sense. If not, reject that input. If they continue on, or it's a text field or some other difficult to validate field, input sanitization is a losing proposition but still better than XSS or SQL injection. If you're already reduced to sanitization or no input validation, make sure output encoding is very strong for your application.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-empty.png" width="100" align="left" style="padding: 15px;" />
<p><strong>Validate Content-Types</strong> - When POSTing or PUTting new data, the client will specify the Content-Type (e.g. application/xml or application/json) of the incoming data. The server should never assume the Content-Type; it should always check that the Content-Type header and the content are the same type. A lack of Content-Type header or an unexpected Content-Type header should result in the server rejecting the content with a 406 Not Acceptable response.

<p><strong>Validate Response Types</strong> - It is common for REST services to allow multiple response types (e.g. application/xml or application/json, and the client specifies the preferred order of response types by the Accept header in the request. Do NOT simply copy the Accept header to the Content-type header of the response. Reject the request (ideally with a 406 Not Acceptable response) if the Accept header does not specifically contain one of the allowable types. Because there are many MIME types for the typical response types, it's important to document for clients specifically which MIME types should be used.

<p><strong>Framework-Provided Validation</strong> - Many frameworks, such as Jersey, allow for validation constraints to be enforced automatically by the framework at request or response time. (See Bean Validation Support for more information). While this does not validate the structure of JSON or XML data before being unmarshaled, it does provide automatic validation after unmarshaling, but before the data is presented to the application.

<p><strong>Send Security Headers</strong> - To make sure the content of a given resources is interpreted correctly by the browser, the server should always send the Content-Type header with the correct Content-Type, and preferably the Content-Type header should include a charset. The server should also send an X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to make sure the browser does not try to detect a different Content-Type than what is actually sent (can lead to XSS).

<p><strong>JSON Encoding</strong> - A key concern with JSON encoders is preventing arbitrary JavaScript remote code execution within the browser... or, if you're using node.js, on the server. It's vital that you use a proper JSON serializer to encode user-supplied data properly to prevent the execution of user-supplied input on the browser.

<p><strong>Buffer Overflow Attack</strong> - Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory fragments of the process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way. Buffer overflow errors occur when we operate on buffers of char type. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_overflow_attack

<p><strong>Overflow Binary Resource File</strong> - The source of a buffer overflow may be input data. When it comes from the Overflow Binary Resource File, the attacker has to modify/prepare the binary file in such a way that the application, after reading this file, has become prone to a classic Buffer overflow attack. The only difference between this attack and the classic one is the source of the input data. Common examples are specially crafted MP3, JPEG or ANI files, which cause buffer overflows. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Overflow_Binary_Resource_File

<p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong> - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)

<p><strong>Account Lockout Attack</strong> - In an account lockout attack, an attacker attempts to lock out user accounts by purposely failing the authentication process as many times as needed to trigger the account lockout functionality. This in turn prevents even the valid user from obtaining access to their account. For example, if an account lockout policy states that users are locked out of their accounts after three failed login attempts, an attacker can lock out accounts by deliberately sending an invalid password three times. On a large scale, this attack can be used as one method in launching a denial of service attack on many accounts. The impact of such an attack is compounded when there is a significant amount of work required to unlock the accounts to allow users to attempt to authenticate again. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Account_lockout_attack

<p><strong>Session Prediction</strong> - The session prediction attack focuses on predicting session ID values that permit an attacker to bypass the authentication schema of an application. By analyzing and understanding the session ID generation process, an attacker can predict a valid session ID value and get access to the application. In the first step, the attacker needs to collect some valid session ID values that are used to identify authenticated users. Then, he must understand the structure of session ID, the information that is used to create it, and the encryption or hash algorithm used by application to protect it. Some bad implementations use sessions IDs composed by username or other predictable information, like timestamp or client IP address. In the worst case, this information is used in clear text or coded using some weak algorithm like base64 encoding. In addition, the attacker can implement a brute force technique to generate and test different values of session ID until he successfully gets access to the application.</p>

<p><strong>PHP Object Injection</strong> - PHP Object Injection is an application level vulnerability that could allow an attacker to perform different kinds of malicious attacks, such as Code Injection, SQL Injection, Path Traversal and Application Denial of Service, depending on the context. The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the unserialize() PHP function. Since PHP allows object serialization, attackers could pass ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable unserialize() call, resulting in an arbitrary PHP object(s) injection into the application scope. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection

<p><strong>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</strong> -  The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS

<p><strong>Resource Injection</strong> - This attack consists of changing resource identifiers used by an application in order to perform a malicious task. When an application permits a user input to define a resource, like a file name or port number, this data can be manipulated to execute or access different resources. In order to be properly executed, the attacker must have the possibility to specify a resource identifier through the application form and the application must permit its execution. The resource type affected by user input indicates the content type that may be exposed. For example, an application that permits input of special characters like period, slash, and backslash is risky when used in methods that interact with the file system. The resource injection attack focuses on accessing other resources than the local filesystem, which is different attack technique known as a Path Manipulation attack. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Resource_Injection

<p><strong>Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection</strong> - SSIs are directives present on Web applications used to feed an HTML page with dynamic contents. They are similar to CGIs, except that SSIs are used to execute some actions before the current page is loaded or while the page is being visualized. In order to do so, the web server analyzes SSI before supplying the page to the user. The Server-Side Includes attack allows the exploitation of a web application by injecting scripts in HTML pages or executing arbitrary codes remotely. It can be exploited through manipulation of SSI in use in the application or force its use through user input fields. It is possible to check if the application is properly validating input fields data by inserting characters that are used in SSI directives - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server-Side_Includes_(SSI)_Injection

<p><strong>Special Element Injection</strong> - Special Element Injection is a type of injection attack that exploits a weakness related to reserved words and special characters. Every programming language and operating system has special characters considered as reserved words for it. However, when an application receives such data as user input, it is possible to observe unexpected behavior in the application when parsing this information. This can lead to information disclosure, access control and authorization bypass, code injection, and many other variants. According to the characters used, the Special Element Injection attack can be performed using macro symbols, parameter delimiter and null characters/null bytes, among others. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Special_Element_Injection

This attack can be performed by a malicious user who wants to exploit the application for their own benefit, or an attacker who wishes to attack a third-person using a Man-in-the-middle attack. In both cases, tools likes Webscarab and Paros proxy are mostly used. The attack success depends on integrity and logic validation mechanism errors, and its exploitation can result in other consequences including XSS, SQL Injection, file inclusion, and path disclosure attacks. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Parameter_Tampering

<p><strong>XPATH Injection</strong> - Similar to SQL Injection, XPath Injection attacks occur when a web site uses user-supplied information to construct an XPath query for XML data. By sending intentionally malformed information into the web site, an attacker can find out how the XML data is structured, or access data that he may not normally have access to. He may even be able to elevate his privileges on the web site if the XML data is being used for authentication (such as an XML based user file). Querying XML is done with XPath, a type of simple descriptive statement that allows the XML query to locate a piece of information. Like SQL, you can specify certain attributes to find, and patterns to match. When using XML for a web site it is common to accept some form of input on the query string to identify the content to locate and display on the page. This input must be sanitized to verify that it doesn't mess up the XPath query and return the wrong data. XPath is a standard language; its notation/syntax is always implementation independent, which means the attack may be automated. There are no different dialects as it takes place in requests to the SQL databases - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XPATH_Injection

<p><strong>Blind SQL Injection</strong> - Blind SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a type of SQL Injection attack that asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based on the applications response. This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages, but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection. When an attacker exploits SQL injection, sometimes the web application displays error messages from the database complaining that the SQL Query's syntax is incorrect. Blind SQL injection is nearly identical to normal SQL Injection, the only difference being the way the data is retrieved from the database. When the database does not output data to the web page, an attacker is forced to steal data by asking the database a series of true or false questions. This makes exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability more difficult, but not impossible. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_SQL_Injection

<p><strong>Blind XPath Injection</strong> - XPath is a type of query language that describes how to locate specific elements (including attributes, processing instructions, etc.) in an XML document. Since it is a query language, XPath is somewhat similar to Structured Query Language (SQL), however, XPath is different in that it can be used to reference almost any part of an XML document without access control restrictions. In SQL, a "user" (which is a term undefined in the XPath/XML context) may be restricted to certain databases, tables, columns, or queries. Using an XPATH Injection attack, an attacker is able to modify the XPATH query to perform an action of his choosing. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_XPath_Injection

<p><strong>Code Injection</strong> - Code Injection is the general term for attack types which consist of injecting code that is then interpreted/executed by the application. This type of attack exploits poor handling of untrusted data. These types of attacks are usually made possible due to a lack of proper input/output data validation, for example: allowed characters (standard regular expressions classes or custom), data format, and amount of expected data. Code Injection differs from Command Injection in that an attacker is only limited by the functionality of the injected language itself. If an attacker is able to inject PHP code into an application and have it executed, he is only limited by what PHP is capable of. Command injection consists of leveraging existing code to execute commands, usually within the context of a shell. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection

<p><strong>Command Injection</strong> - Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code injection allows the attacker to add his own code that is then executed by the application. In Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application without the necessity of executing system commands. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection

There are many ways to make a service unavailable for legitimate users by manipulating network packets, programming, logical, or resources handling vulnerabilities, among others. If a service receives a very large number of requests, it may cease to be available to legitimate users. In the same way, a service may stop if a programming vulnerability is exploited, or the way the service handles resources it uses. Sometimes the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code while performing a DoS attack in order to access critical information or execute commands on the server.

<p><strong>HTTP Request Smuggling</strong> - The HTTP Request Smuggling attack explores an incomplete parsing of the submitted data done by an intermediary HTTP system working as a proxy. HTTP Request Smuggling consists of sending a specially formatted HTTP request that will be parsed in a different way by the proxy system and by the final system, so the attacker could smuggle a request to one system without the other being aware of it. This attack makes it possible to exploit other attacks, like Cache Poisoning, Session Hijacking, Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and most importantly, the ability to bypass web application firewall protection. To exploit the HTTP Request Smuggling, some specific conditions must exist, such as the presence of specific proxy system and version such as SunOne Proxy 3.6 (SP4) or FW-1/FP4-R55W beta or an XSS vulnerability in the web server. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Request_Smuggling

<p><strong>HTTP Response Splitting</strong> - HTTP response splitting occurs when: Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without being validated for malicious characters.
HTTP response splitting is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At its root, the attack is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header. To mount a successful exploit, the application must allow input that contains CR (carriage return, also given by %0d or \r) and LF (line feed, also given by %0a or \n)characters into the header AND the underlying platform must be vulnerable to the injection of such characters. These characters not only give attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response the application intends to send, but also allow them to create additional responses entirely under their control. - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting
