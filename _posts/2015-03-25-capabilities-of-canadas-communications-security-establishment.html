<p>This sort of comment,
Back in 2011, CSE envisioned creating a perimeter around Canada to better defend the countrys interests from potential threats from other countries and criminals, raising the prospect the agency was preparing a broad surveillance program to target Canadiansâ€™ online traffic.kind of annoys me when they say perimeter, it gives entirely the wrong impression of whats involved not just from the defence but attack positions.It makes many politicos and others take up magical thinking thus they nolonger see things the way they should and thus they will make mistakes that the IC will take significant advantage of.When you are dealing with a network where anyone can connect to not just in the Canadian jurisdiction but out side as well there is no perimeter.Thus every host with a connection is a potential defender or attacker, and can not be told apart untill an attack vector is used against it or from it, even then it may just be one link in a long chain, where identifing other connectivity to an attacking host is not realistic.</p>
