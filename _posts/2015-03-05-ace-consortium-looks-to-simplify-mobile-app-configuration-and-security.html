<p>Looking to standardize how providers of management applications invoke APIs on mobile computing applications, the AirWatch unit of VMware, Box, Cisco, Workday and Xamarin today announced an open App Configuration for Enterprise (ACE) initiative.Announced at the Mobile World Congress 2015 conference, Kabir Barday, lead product manager for application development at AirWatch by VMware, says that in collaboration with other vendors AirWatch is trying to standardize the best practices for invoking mobile application APIs.As an open initiative, Barday says AirWatch is inviting not only providers of cloud applications to participate in the effort, but other providers of enterprise mobile management (EMM) software as well.The initiative is intended to create an alternative to proprietary approaches to configuring and securing mobile applications.Barday says that the industry as a whole needs to standardize on an open approach to configuring, securing, and wrapping containers around mobile applications that invoke the APIs developed by Apple and Google.</p>
