<p>Citigroup has warned against trusting sensitive information to law firms, which aren’t required to reveal data breaches and often cover them up.The New York Times viewed a copy of the report published by Citigroup’s cyber-intelligence center, which works to identify threats before they can affect financial institutions and their customers.Key among its findings was:
Due to the reluctance of most law firms to publicly discuss cyberintrusions and the lack of data breach reporting requirements in general in the legal industry, it is not possible to determine whether cyberattacks against law firms are on the rise.In the last several months, Mandiant, the security firm that is a division of the security consultant FireEye, has been advising a half-dozen unidentified law firms that were victims of a breach or other attack, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Information stolen from law firms might also allow hackers to conduct phishing attacks, which trick people into sharing sensitive information by emulating friends, loved ones, and other people the target is known to trust.</p>
