<p>Tinders private API has been hacked, yet again.Â Tinderbots, programs that utilize the Tinder API for unauthorized use, have been on the rise lately.The unauthorized use of Tinders private API has led to both malignant and benign uses of the dating app.The most recent hack, undoubtedly malign from Tinders point of view, makes for a good laugh to some, but a broader statement about humanity to others.The API tweak creates a fake female profile that engages two heterosexual males in a conversation.</p>
