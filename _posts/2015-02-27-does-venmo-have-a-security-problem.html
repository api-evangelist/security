<p>Its a familiar sinking feeling.What if the easy app you use all the time is leaving you vulnerable to a digital attack?Even worse, what if the features that make it easy to use are the same ones that make it vulnerable?Thats the case made in a Slate piece by Alison Griswold yesterday, taking Venmo to task for lax security practices.Griswold followed a user whose account had been compromised and drained of close to $3000.</p>
