<p>David Bozin is the VP of Business Development at Bindo, a New York based unique retail technology company with an innovative iPad POS system and soon-to-be launched online Marketplace.With Apple Pay coming out, it seems as if there is a whole new technology that has just been released.In reality, NFC payments have been around for a while, but Apple is the platform that has enough user adoption that will actually result in mass adoption.Thus far, we have seen just the start, with further tech such as the Apple Watch supplementing further growth.With mass adoption of a new technology, especially one dealing with that which we value so highly (money), there will be ever increasing attention from all sides of the table.</p>
