<p>According to a new report from Citizen Lab, China has not only built itself a Great Cannon but has already fired it as well.This potent online weapon seems to be capable of intercepting internet traffic at the national level then directing it at specific networks to knock them offline.Chinas already widely suspected of being behind the recent attack against Github, which was overloaded for nearly a week via an ongoing and evolving large DDOS attack.Now it appears that Githubs attackers used the Cannon to redirect that traffic from Chinese search engine giant Baidu to cripple the website.All reportedly because the San Francisco-based website hosted a pair of pages that link to content banned in China.</p>
