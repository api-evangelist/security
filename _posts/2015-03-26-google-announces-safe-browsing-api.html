<p>Google has announced that the company’s malware-blocking software data is now publicly available.Developers can now incorporate additional security measures into web and mobile applications using the Google Safe Browsing API.Safe Browsing is a service provided by Google that is capable of checking URLs to see whether they are included in Google’s lists of web pages suspected of phishing, malware, and unwanted software.There are two APIs (both experimental) available for the Google Safe Browsing service: Safe Browsing API v3 and Safe Browsing Lookup API.The Safe Browsing API allows applications to download an encrypted table that can be used client-side to check the safety of URLs.</p>
