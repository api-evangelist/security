<p>Last week, the Ponemon Institute unveiled a new study commissioned by IBM that examines how more than 400 large organizations, including those we tend to inherently trust – Fortune 500 companies in the banking, retail, health and public sectors – develop mobile apps, and how secure they are before they reach the hands of consumers.The findings were troubling.40 percent of companies do not scan their apps for cybersecurity vulnerabilities before making them available, creating huge windows of opportunity for data breaches.The average company tests less than half of the mobile apps they build, and 33 percent never test their apps.Even more shocking is that 50 percent of companies dedicate zero budget towards securing the mobile apps they build for customers, who often – and without hesitation — upload some of their most confidential billing, personal, and business data.</p>
