<p>Fast-growing team-messaging software company Slack today disclosed that a database containing user information got hacked for a brief period last month.This is the first time Slack has come forward about a hack it has endured.It’s notable because the company is taking on so many users so quickly.Last year Slack dealt with a perceived security flaw: that it was possible to see the names of teams inside companies using Slack.“Slack maintains a central user database which includes user names, email addresses, and one-way encrypted (‘hashed’) passwords,” Slack’s Anne Toth wrote in a blog post today.</p>
