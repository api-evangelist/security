<p>Alongside the Great Firewall, China has been developing a new way to intercept and redirect internet traffic, according toÂ a new report from Citizen Lab.The report looks at the recent denial-of-service attack against Github, which flooded the site with bad traffic for five days, resulting in intermittent downtime.Chinas cybersecurity administration had been suspected as the source of attacks, but the new report lays out the evidence in more damning detail, showing the redirection occurring as traffic enters China Telecom, indicating it is part of the same infrastructure as Chinas Great Firewall.The attack on Github worked by tampering with an analytics script that the Chinese web giant Baidu distributes.Anyone visiting a site with the script would normally send back data to Baidu and receive a reply, but the Cannon intercepted that data in transit, inserting a new script that would blast Github with bad traffic.</p>
