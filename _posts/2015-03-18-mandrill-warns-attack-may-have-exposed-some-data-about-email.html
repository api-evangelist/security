<p>Mandrill warned customers on Wednesday that some email-related data may have been exposed after attackers tried to lasso some of its servers into a botnet.Data doesn’t appear to have been stolen, but some customers should take some security precautions, wrote Brandon Fouts, general manager of Mandrill, which is a platform for managing transactional email that is owned by The Rocket Science Group.“There’s not evidence that any customer data was queried or exported, but unfortunately we can’t completely rule out the possibility of access,” Fouts wrote in a blog post.Data that may have been exposed includes internal logs about emails sent, including sender and recipient addresses but not custom metadata or the content of messages, Fouts wrote.The customers who may have been affected used Mandrill to send email between Feb.</p>
