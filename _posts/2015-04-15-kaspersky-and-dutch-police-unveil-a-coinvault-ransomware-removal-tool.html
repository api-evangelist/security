<p>Kaspersky and Dutch police released a program that can help remove ransomware CoinVault.The nasty breed of ransomware is spread by corrupted email attachments.Once clicked, it encrypts files on Windows computer with 256-bit AES encryption.The owner cannot access computer files again unless he or she pays a bitcoin fee.Victims dont have time to brainstorm a fix either.</p>
