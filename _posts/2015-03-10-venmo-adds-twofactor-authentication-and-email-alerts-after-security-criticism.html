<p>Payment service Venmo was criticized last month for lax security measures after one of its users had their account compromised and drained of almost $3,000.In response, the company has announced that it is beefing up security measures, introducing email notifications that will be sent out whenever a users email address, password, or phone number changes, and implementing multi-factor authentication for user logins in the coming weeks.The company issued an apology for the breach
A Slate report, published in February, told the story of a Venmo user whose account had been compromised.Because the company didnt notify users when login details were changed, the malicious individual was able to get into the account and drain it of almost $3,000 before the owner noticed the breach.Speaking shortly after the Slate article was published, Venmo CEO Bill Ready said that the company usually preferred to address fraud without alerting the user for experience reasons.</p>
