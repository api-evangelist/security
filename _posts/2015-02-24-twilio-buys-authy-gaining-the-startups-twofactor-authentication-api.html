<p>Communication-as-a-service provider Twilio has purchased the Y Combinator-backed startup Authy.Financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.Authy specializes in two-factor authentication, a measure used to ensure account security.Developers can use its authentication API to embed two-factor authentication and phone verification within applications.In addition to entering a password online, a user of a two-factor authenticated application is required to enter a random verification code generated upon login.</p>
