<p>Heres an interesting technique to detect Remote Access Trojans, or RATS: differences in how local and remote users use the keyboard and mouse:
By using biometric analysis tools, we are able to analyze cognitive traits such as hand-eye coordination, usage preferences, as well as device interaction patterns to identify a delay or latency often associated with remote access attacks.Simply put, a RATs keyboard typing or cursor movement will often cause delayed visual feedback which in turn results in delayed response time; the data is simply not as fluent as would be expected from standard human behavior data.No data on false positives vs.false negatives, but interesting nonetheless..</p>
