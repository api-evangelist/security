<p>The upcoming deprecation of version 1 of Facebook’s Graph API has had developers long preparing their applications to work with the latest version of the API.The change has had at least one unintended effect, possibly leaving some motor-impaired Facebook users unable to use their news feed.As reported last week, Tobii, the makers of Tobii Communicator, a Windows-based eye-tracking application, had to this point been unable to update the app in a way that would meet Facebook’s new guidelines.For nearly a year, Facebook has enforced a policy that gives users more control over the information they share with apps.Under the new API, a user can grant a third-party app access to Facebook while blocking the app from viewing their news feed which would include posts from the user’s friends that may not have the app installed.</p>
