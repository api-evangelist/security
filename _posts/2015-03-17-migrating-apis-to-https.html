<p>All APIs should use and require HTTPS to help guarantee confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity.HTTPS provides a stronger guarantee that a client is communicating with the real API and receiving back authentic contents.It also enhances privacy for applications and users using the API.For APIs that support cross-origin request sharing (CORS) or JSONP requests, it also ensures the requests are not blocked as mixed content.All new APIs should use and require HTTPS.</p>
