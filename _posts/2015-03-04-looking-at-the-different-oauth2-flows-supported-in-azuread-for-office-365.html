<p>Lately you might you might notice Ive been on a bit of a kick with Azure AD in some recent blog posts.In this post I want to talk about some of the different OAuth2 authentication flows that Azure AD supports.Specifically I want to look at three of them:
One thing is common between all these flows - the ultimate goal is to get an access token that you can use to authenticate with a resource that trusts Azure AD.These three flows give you three options to do that.Check out my Pluralsight course Office 365 APIs - Overview, Authentication and the Discovery Service, specifically modules 3 & 4, that go deep into the authentication process.</p>
