<p>In December, Googles Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt was interviewed at the CATO Institute Surveillance Conference.One of the things he said, after talking about some of the security measures his company has put in place post-Snowden, was: If you have important information, the safest place to keep it is in Google.And I can assure you that the safest place to not keep it is anywhere else.The surprised me, because Google collects all of your information to show you more targeted advertising.Surveillance is the business model of the Internet, and Google is one of the most successful companies at that.</p>
