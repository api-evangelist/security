<p>This story began a few months ago when I got a popular brand of fitness bracelet.As this is a wearable device I installed Android Wear app, an application developed especially for wearable devices.This application easily connects to the fitness band.However, there was something odd: the program could connect to a Nike+ Fuel Band SE, but my bracelet was another brand!It wasnt long before I realized my colleague had a Nike wristband â€“ and he didnt even notice I had connected to his device.</p>
