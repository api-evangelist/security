<p>Before I get into the code and walk you through it, I wanted to talk about my motivation for this post.I recently spoke at the Confoo developer conference in Montreal.If you haven’t been, it’s a whirlwind of new technologies, complex data theories, useful soft skills, and solid, practical information for technologists of all sorts and levels.I’ve had the pleasure of attending (and speaking) the last two years and I always find an abundance of good information and good networking opportunities.This year was the first time that StrongLoop has had a presence, but given the contacts made with both users of LoopBack and new potential partners like Riak and Nexmo, I hope we are able to go back next year.</p>
