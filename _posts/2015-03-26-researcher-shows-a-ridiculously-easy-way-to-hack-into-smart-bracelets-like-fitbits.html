<p>A Russian security researcher was able to hack into his own smart bracelet in a relatively easy way (well, easy for a programmer).Roman Unuchek, a mobile threats expert at Kaspersy Lab, built an application that connected with dozens of devices in the wild and surreptitiously hacked into his own bracelet.Â He would not divulge what kind of device it is.Smart bracelets are generally considered to be the dumbest of the smart wrist devices.They include Jawbones, Fitbits, Nike Fuel Bands, and numerous others that have no digital display but track movements and other biometric data.</p>
