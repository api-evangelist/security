<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.They use X.509 certificates and hence asymmetric cryptography to authenticate the counterparty with whom they are communicating, and to negotiate a symmetric key.This session key is then used to encrypt data flowing between the parties.This allows for data/message confidentiality, and message authentication codes for message integrity and as a by-product, message authentication.</p>
