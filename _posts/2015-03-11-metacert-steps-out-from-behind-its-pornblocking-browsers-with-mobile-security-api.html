The last time I wrote about MetaCert, the company was fooling around with social media tools and working on its iPad browser, which blocked access to pornography.Now it’s putting all the data it collected through those tools to another use.MetaCert is now peddling an API developers can use to improve the security of their mobile applications or stop pornographic content from ever appearing in them.The company wants to make sure mobile apps — especially those which allow consumers to view Web content — can offer as many protections as their desktop counterparts.To ensure that developers know its services are available, MetaCert has partnered with AppMakr, a development tool that allows people to make apps even if they don’t know how to code.</p>
