<p>IBMs X-Force Application Security Reseach Team revealed the existence of a severe vulnerability in the Dropbox SDK for Android.The now-patched vulnerability, dubbed DroppedIn by IBMs researchers, allowed an attacker to connect applications on a users mobile device to a Dropbox account that they controlled.Although Dropbox asserts no files were compromised before the patch, the vulnerability could have allowed a cyberattacker to steal potentially sensitive information and inject malicious data into third-party apps.IBM says it first reported the vulnerability to Dropbox in December, and in a blog post, IBM researchers actually praise Dropbox for its minutes-long response time and the fact that it issued a patch within four days.Must See Gallery
