<p>Critical vulnerabilities exist in several JSON Web Token (JWT) libraries – namely the JavaScript and PHP versions – that could let an attacker bypass the verification step.Tim McLean, a Canadian security researcher who specializes in cryptography and dug up the issues, points out that attackers could exploit one of those vulnerabilities, which abuses an asymmetric signing algorithm, in some JWT libraries.Introduced a few years back, JWT is a standard that produces tokens between two parties.For example, a server can produce an admin token, transferred in JSON, and signed by the server’s key.Clients can go on to use that token to verify the user is logged in as an admin.</p>
