<p>Encryption is a process used to convert plain text data into Ciphertext and thus protecting information from getting read by unauthorized users.Data can be encrypted both while travelling over the Internet or when it is stored on servers.Encryption is used in the cloud to safeguard sensitive information stored and travelling through internal networks, the Internet, and wireless mobile devices.Encryption in the cloud is particularly important for data security because the data is outside of the enterprise and general information security controls are not applicable in the cloud.It is also commonly used for compliance with industry regulations such as HIPAA and PCI DSS.</p>
