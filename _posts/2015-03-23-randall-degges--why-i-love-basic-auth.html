<p>One of the disturbing trends Ive noticed over the past few years is that more and more API services are slowly ditching support for HTTP Basic Authentication (aka: Basic Auth) in favor of OAuth.As someone whos been:
Using REST API services for years.Has built numerous REST API services.Has built and ran a REST API company.Is currently working at a large developer-focused REST API company.</p>
