<p>Securing your applications on the public web is an essential part of deploying any application.Various tools exist to test out against known vulnerabilities in web applications and if you have a web application hosted on Google App Engine, you know that because of a sandbox runtime, it has not been easy to pick and choose the testing tool of your choice.This is no longer the case with the release of Google Cloud Security Scanner, which aims to do just that.Google Cloud Security Scanner, announced in a Beta release, can help you test your web application against known vulnerabilities.This tool is integrated right within the Developer Console for your Google Cloud Platform project.</p>
