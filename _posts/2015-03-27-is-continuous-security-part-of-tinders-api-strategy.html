<p>Have we completely forgotten that some doors need locks…that work?With companies like Apple, Tinder, and SnapChat releasing APIs that have significant security concerns, it makes you wonder what, if any, process do app and service providers have to make sure they’re safe from attack.Everyone’s scrambling to build, deploy, scale, and support great experiences, that it’s common practice to underplay security testing even in the most enlightened continuous delivery models.I work at a company where we consider APIs fundamental to all people and businesses.Dev shops, multinationals, public sector, health and finance, you name it, they use our software.</p>
