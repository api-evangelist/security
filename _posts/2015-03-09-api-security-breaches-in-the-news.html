<p>I have a confession: blogging can be a chore.But for some reason, sitting down to write is never quite as difficult when I’m inspired by a real-world security breach or data leak.Perhaps it’s a perverse bit of schadenfreude or the ever-present challenge of fighting a cyber-war against globally-distributed hackers looking to attack enterprise IT systems, but these topics are always the most invigorating. 
However, in the past year, I’ve gotten at least four notices from companies with which I’ve done business – retail merchants, entertainment vendors, healthcare providers, even my university – about potential data losses.And that tends to change one’s perspective.</p>
