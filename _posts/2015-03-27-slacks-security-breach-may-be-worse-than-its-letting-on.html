<p>Earlier today the work-based chat application Slack revealed that its database was breached.The company, which is said to be worth something north of $2 billion, confirmed in a blog post that “there was unauthorized access to a Slack database storing user profile information.” 
Security researchers are now looking into what went wrong and how the breach may affect users.While Slack assured customers that all its passwords were encrypted, dont breathe a sigh of relief.“The company is emphasizing that the passwords are encrypted and salted, but that simply means they will take just a little longer to crack,” said Alex Heid, chief research officer at SecurityScorecard.</p>
