<p>The never-ending cycle of vulnerability discovery and remediation continues this week with an announcement from IBM concerning a “Droppedin” flaw in an SDK from Dropbox that affects applications running on Android devices.Michael Montecillo, director of security intelligence for IBM, says that the IBM X-Force Application Security Research team has already informed Dropbox of the issue.For its part, Dropbox reports that a few months ago it patched what it calls a minor security vulnerability in the Android Core and Sync/Datastore SDKs.While most popular apps have already updated their Android SDKs, Dropbox says it now wants to make sure all of its Android developers update their apps to use Core API Android SDK v1.6.</p>
