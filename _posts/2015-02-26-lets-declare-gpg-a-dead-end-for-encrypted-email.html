<p>I receive a fair amount of email from strangers.My email address is public, which doesn’t seem to be a popular choice these days, but I’ve received enough inspiring correspondence over the years to leave it be.When I receive a GPG encrypted email from a stranger, though, I immediately get the feeling that I don’t want to read it.Sometimes I actually contemplate creating a filter for them so that they bypass my inbox entirely, but for now I sigh, unlock my key, start reading, and – with a faint glimmer of hope – am typically disappointed.I didn’t start out thinking this way.</p>
