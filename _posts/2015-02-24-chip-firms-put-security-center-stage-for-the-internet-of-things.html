<p>Big names in the semiconductor world announced more secure hardware Tuesday, while another outlined a framework it wants to offer startups to help bolster security when it comes to building connected devices.Both NXP and Atmel released new security-rich microcontrollers that come equipped with some security features built in that could take some serious spec sheets to compare and contrast.However, itâ€™s clear from the announcements at the Embedded World Conference in Germany that when it comes to connected devices, the microcontrollers will have more features built into them to support encryption and other features more familiar from higher-end processor cores such as random number generators on the chip and secure booting.In the case of the NXP devices they can be combined with additional hardware to prevent physical tampering for use in connected products such as smart electricity meters or even parking meters.The emphasis on security at the hardware level is becoming more important as microcontrollers are becoming the brains of connected products, according to Jim Trent, VP & GM of the Microcontroller Business at NXP (pictured above).</p>
