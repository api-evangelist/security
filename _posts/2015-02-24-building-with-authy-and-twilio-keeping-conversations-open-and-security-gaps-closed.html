<p>Communication at its core is just a conversation between two parties.We love good conversation, and we want to make as easy as possible for you build apps that power those connections, and do it securely.Today, we welcomed Authy to the Twilio tribe to make it even easier for you to integrate strong user identification into anything you’re building.Sign up for Authy, and learn how to implement two factor authentication in Node Express right here.Back in 2011, Daniel Palacio was getting Authy off the ground in a security landscape that’s virtually unrecognizable now.</p>
