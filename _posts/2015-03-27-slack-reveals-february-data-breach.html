<p>Slack has announced that its customers’ usernames, passwords, and email addresses were compromised by hackers who broke into the company’s internal servers.In response, Slack has added two-factor authentication along with a feature that allows team leaders to force employees to reset their passwords and log back into the service.Slack also assured users that its passwords were encrypted and that there is no indication the hackers were able to break that encryption — which is very good news.Had hackers broken the encryption, they would have accessed not only passwords associated with Slack accounts, but also those associated with other services where customers used the same password — a risky habit that’s become all-too-common.Data breaches are never good news, but this might be especially bad for Slack which — as a service that often stewards proprietary data and private communications within enterprises — needs its users’ trust to function.</p>
