<p>Facebook introduced ThreatExchange last month as a way for tech companies to share information about malware and other security threats, and the social network announced Friday that the application-programming-interface documentation for ThreatExchange, as well as the PHP and Python reference code, are now available on GitHub.Facebook threat infrastructure team manager Mark Hammell also offered details on how graph-based sharing of threat intelligence works in a note on the ThreatExchange page:
The first thing to understand about the design of ThreatExchange is that it’s a subset of APIs residing within the much larger set of Graph APIs used by third-party developers to programmatically interact with Facebook.Much like any other third-party developer, a ThreatExchange member starts by creating a Facebook platform application and then uses it to query or post threat data into ThreatExchange.Once Facebook grants access to a developer’s application, they interact with ThreatExchange by issuing RESTful API calls to the Facebook platform.This API based approach works well for our current members, all of whom are looking to integrate the data available via ThreatExchange into their existing security systems.</p>
