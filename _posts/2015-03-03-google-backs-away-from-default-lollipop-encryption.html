<p>Lollipop device encryption by default is still in the future.No conspiracy here; it seems like they dont have the appropriate drivers yet.But while relaxing the requirement might make sense technically, its not a good public relations move.Tags: Android, encryption, Google, operating systems
Nothing stops you from enabling encryption manually, even on earlier Android releases.Im using KitKat and have the system encrypted.</p>
