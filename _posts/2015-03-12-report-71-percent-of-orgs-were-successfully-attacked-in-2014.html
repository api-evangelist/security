Report: 71 percent of orgs were successfully attacked in 2014
A third of respondents said that their organization conducts full-network active vulnerability scans less often than quarterly.The number of successful cyber attacks against organizations is increasing, according to the “2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report” from CyberEdge Group, which surveyed 814 IT security decision makers and practitioners from organizations – in 19 industries – across North America and Europe.Altogether, 71 percent of respondents said that their organizations global network was compromised by a successful cyber attack in 2014 – a number that jumped up from 62 percent in the year prior – and 22 percent said that their organization experienced six or more successful attacks, according to the report.Not patching vulnerabilities is one reason successful attacks are on the rise, Steve Piper, CEO of CyberEdge Group, told SCMagazine.com in a Thursday email correspondence.</p>
