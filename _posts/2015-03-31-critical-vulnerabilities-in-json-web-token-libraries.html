<p>Recently, while reviewing the security of various JSON Web Token implementations, I found many libraries with critical vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass the verification step.The same two flaws were found across many implementations and languages, so I thought it would be helpful to write up exactly where the problems occur.I believe that a change to the standard could help prevent future vulnerabilities.For those who are unfamiliar, JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard for creating tokens that assert some number of claims.For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim logged in as admin and provide that to a client.</p>
