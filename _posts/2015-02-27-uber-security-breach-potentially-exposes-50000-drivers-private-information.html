<p>Last year Uber suffered a security breach.Now it’s saying that the name and driver’s license number of up to 50,000 drivers could be in the hands of a third party.The Los Angeles Times reports that the company’s databases had been accessed by an unknown third party twice in 2014.In one instance, the database contained the information of Uber drivers.Uber has reached out California’s attorney general about the breach and to current and former drivers about the breach.</p>
