<p>Online privacy and data protection is an issue that seems to be impossible for companies to deal with.In its latest X-Force report, IBM claims that over 1 billion pieces of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) were leaked in 2014.If that number sounds large, it isn’t.IBM doesn’t say each piece of PII relates to a separate user just that 1 billion pieces were leaked.With the vast majority of websites gathering some form of PII it means that a breach at a large company will yield millions of pieces of PII.</p>
