<p>Outside of a mobile application’s official product, there tends to exist a broader ecosystem catering the wants and unmet desires of its user community.For Instagram, there are apps to boost your followers; Tinder users could once peer into who likes them and undo their accidental swipes; and dozens Snapchat apps bloomed, allowing users to automatically save incoming photos or share items pre-recorded items from their phone’s Camera Roll.But in the latter case, at least, those apps will be no more.While many today are still available for download in Google and Apple’s mobile app stores, the company confirmed this week what many users have been realizing for months now – these apps will no longer work, and they’ll soon be forced to shut down entirely.Given Snapchat’s popularity, it’s not surprising that massive numbers of third-party applications have been created, including apps like SaveSnap, Snap Sender, UploadSnap, Snap Keeper, SnapBox, Snap Save, Upload’n’Roll, Snap Up, Save for Snapchat, Snap-Hack, Snap Upload, SnapPad, Snap Up, SnapSend, the infamous Snapsaved, and many more.</p>
