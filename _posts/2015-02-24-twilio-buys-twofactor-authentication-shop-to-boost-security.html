<p>Twilio, the cloud-based communication service provider that lets developers craft messaging applications, is buying security startup Authy for an undisclosed price.As part of the deal, announced Tuesday, Authy’s entire twelve-person team will move over to Twilio.Authy focusses on two-factor authentication, which adds a second step to the password verification process commonly used to log into online accounts.In addition to filling out a password to access a sensitive website or application, a user might receive a ping via his or her phone that contains an extra code that acts as a secondary password.The Authy team developed an API that, in theory, makes it easier for developers to build two-factor authentication into their applications, explained Authy president and COO Marc Boroditsky in an interview.</p>
