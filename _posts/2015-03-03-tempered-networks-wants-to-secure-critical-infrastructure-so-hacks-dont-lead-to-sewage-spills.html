<p>Although the rise of the internet of things means that organizations could gather enormous quantities of data through the billions of connected devices out there today, the big elephant in the room is that security is not where it needs to be, which means there’s a lot more access points for thieves to hack into.Tempered Networks, a Seattle-based security startup, aims to solve this problem and it plans to announce on Tuesday that it brought in a $15 million series A investment round, bringing the company’s total funding to $22 million.Tempered Networks focuses on protecting the type of critical infrastructure that people “take for granted” in their daily lives, said Tempered Networks President and CEO Jeff Hussey.This type of infrastructure includes facilities like electric dams, pipelines that distribute natural gas, nuclear power plants and wastewater plants.This type of infrastructure helps move the gears of the modern world and if something were to go awry in one of these facilities, there’s a chance that the pandemonium caused could be of several times more magnitude than your typical run-of-the-mill data breach.</p>
