<p>Endpoint threat detection company Red Canary has open sourced its Python API (CbApi2), which provides easy and more efficient programmatic access to Carbon Black data.Simply put, it’s about substantially reducing the amount of written code required to get the most out of the Carbon Black REST API.The two main goals that the folks at Red Canary set out to achieve with CbApi2 were to make working with the Carbon Black database a lot like working with Python objects, and to greatly reduce the required number of requests to the server.One of the main design focuses was to provide users with a simple way to achieve high-performance access to Carbon Black.By implementing performance optimizations such as lazy querying (no query is performed until the code attempts to enumerate the result set), caching document results for a maximum of 1 minute and the fact that, with regard to search results, CbApi2 will not retrieve the full process document until absolutely necessary, the company has found a way to achieve this.</p>
