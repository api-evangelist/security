<p>All sites hosted on Heroku that use the default 
herokuapp.com
 domain name are available via HTTPS at no additional cost.However, to use SSL with a custom domain name, you have to buy and install your own SSL certificate.In the past, this used to be a complicated and time-consuming process, but today, with companies like SSLMate, it only takes a few minutes.At the time of writing, the two easiest ways to configure SSL for a custom domain on Heroku are via SSLMate, and the ExpeditedSSL Heroku add-on.</p>
