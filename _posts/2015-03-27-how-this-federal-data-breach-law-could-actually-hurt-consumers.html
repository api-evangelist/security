<p>With each passing brand name mega-breach--Home Depot, Target, JPMorgan Chase, Anthem--it becomes ever more urgent for government and industry to get on the same page about how to protect consumers.Sadly, not all laws are created equal, and there are few better examples of this homespun truth than a would-be federal law currently wending its way through Congress.And not to put too fine a point on it, the Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2015, in its current form, has a long way to go before it should become the law of the land.The Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2015, aims to tackle the nations growing data security threats and challenges.So far, that sounds pretty good to me.</p>
