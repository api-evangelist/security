<p>You probably heard that we announced a security incident earlier today.If you didnâ€™t see the blog post, you will have seen the emails.At the same time, we released Two Factor Authentication.This release was earlier than planned and it still had a few kinks (we wanted to get it out as soon as possible).Smoothing those kinks out requires some changes to our authentication system which will cause a small pain in the butts of many mobile users.</p>
