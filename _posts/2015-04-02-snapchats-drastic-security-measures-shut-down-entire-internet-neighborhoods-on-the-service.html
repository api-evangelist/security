<p>As Snapchat’s popularity has grown, so has its need to adopt proper security practices.In the past two years the company — which was most recently valued at $19 billion — faced a series of spam problems, issues with third-party applications accessing its API, and then one of the most publicized data breaches in recent memory.Of late, the company has taken an extremely firm stance on security, including a strategy that may have affected innocent user accounts, according to a new interview on Backchannel.In 2013, while the company was focusing on fixing other issues, a hacker noticed that anyone could easily link usernames and phone numbers.The hacker then posted this information online.</p>
