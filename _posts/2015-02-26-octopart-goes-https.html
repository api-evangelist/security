<p>In January, Octopart began redirecting all users to the HTTPS version of the site.This means that your Octopart experience is now secured by the Transport Layer Security protocol which provides authentication and encryption of traffic between your computer and Octopart.In short, your searches and activity on Octopart are more secure.This benefit requires no change on your end except to make sure you’re using a modern web browser like Chrome or Firefox.Octopart distributors need to be aware that you may no longer see Octopart as a referral source of traffic through your web analytics platform.</p>
