<p>This week we learned about an attack called FREAK -- Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys -- that can break the encryption of many websites.Basically, some sites implementations of secure sockets layer technology, or SSL, contain both strong encryption algorithms and weak encryption algorithms.Connections are supposed to use the strong algorithms, but in many cases an attacker can force the website to use the weaker encryption algorithms and then decrypt the traffic.From Ars Technica:
In recent days, a scan of more than 14 million websites that support the secure sockets layer or transport layer security protocols found that more than 36 percent of them were vulnerable to the decryption attacks.The exploit takes about seven hours to carry out and costs as little as $100 per site.</p>
