<p>Popular two-factor authentication service Authy, which had over 1 million active users as of November 2014, has today been acquired by Twilio.Twilio provides APIs for developers to integrate SMS and voice calls into their apps and says that the Authy acquisition will mean that it can provide a cloud-based API for developers to embed two-factor verification into any application.The company touts 6,000 websites using Authy’s two-factor API, like Coinbase and CloudFlare.It also touted that 500,000 developers registered on Twilio, making the acquisition a great match.Authy will continue to provide services at its current website after the acquisition, along with its consumer apps which are available for iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.</p>
