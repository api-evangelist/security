<p>We were recently able to confirm that there was unauthorized access to a Slack database storing user profile information.We have since blocked this unauthorized access and made additional changes to our technical infrastructure to prevent future incidents.We have also released two factor authentication and we strongly encourage all users to enable this security feature.We are very aware that our service is essential to many teams.Earning your trust through the operation of a secure service will always be our highest priority.</p>
