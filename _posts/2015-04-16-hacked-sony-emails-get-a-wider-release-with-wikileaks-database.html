<p>Sonys biggest drama of last year is getting a wider release — and the company is less than thrilled.Wikileaks on Thursday published a searchable database of more than 30,000 documents and 173,000 emails from Sony Pictures, all part of the trove of leaked files from the Sony hack last year, which rocked the companys leadership and nearly scuttled the release of The Interview.The initial Sony hack, in December, was accessible mainly to journalists and quickly removed from torrent sites.Sony lawyers also explored legal action, which had a chilling effect on many news outlets.A sequel is the last thing that the company — bleeding red ink in the words of one analyst with Nomura — needs at the moment.</p>
