<p>The last time we heard from Kwikdesk CEO Kevin Abosch, we were talking to him about his other job as an internationally-renowned artist and the fact that ISIS stole one of his photos.This time, his startup, which focuses on secure data products, is launching a new service for developers building apps that handle sensitive data.CryptoShift is a RESTful API that allows devs to add end-to-end encryption to their push notifications to ensure only the intended recipients can read them.The product is particularly focused on developers creating apps that need to comply with the US’s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations on the handling and transmission of medical information.The service has opened signups for its developer preview now, with a freemium model launching shortly.</p>
