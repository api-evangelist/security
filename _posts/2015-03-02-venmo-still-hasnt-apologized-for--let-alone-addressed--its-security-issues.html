Venmo isn’t responding to criticism of its security practices as well as some might like.Its security was questioned last week when Slate revealed that it doesn’t inform users when their passwords are changed, nor when new email accounts are connected to existing Venmo accounts, which allowed one thief to make off with about $2,850 of a Venmo user’s money.The service usually informs its users when money has been transferred.In addition to adding a new email address to the account and changing its password, however, the thief disabled those notifications.The theft, in other words, didn’t ring any of Venmo’s bells.</p>
