<p>I have to fill out a “forgot password” page at least once a week.That’s probably why I’m so excited about passwordless authentication.Passwordless authentication is a system where the application you’re logging into generates a one time use token for you to log in with and delivers that token via SMS or some other means.You can then verify this password from the device you were attempting to log in with.In January we started a series of blog posts building out our own application that supports passwordless authentication.</p>
