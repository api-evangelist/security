<p>In a move that extends the scope of its cloud services to include two-factor authentication, Twilio today announced the acquisition of Authy.Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson says that while many developers have been using Twilio to provide a form of two-factor authentication, Authy provides a much simpler API that also give customers access to policy management and reporting tools to provide that same capability.Used as an alternative to simple passwords that can be easily stolen or compromised, two-factor authentication has emerged as an alternative that is widely being used by developers who are tired of seeing data stolen from within their applications.Lawson says that Twilio will continue to offer Authy as a stand-alone service.In fact, Twilio has been providing voice and SMS services to Authy since 2012.</p>
