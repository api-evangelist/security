<p>I was recently tasked with augmenting the means by which an application authenticated its users.Specifically, the customer wanted to authenticate using ADFS 2.0.After an initial investigation, this seemed very reasonable as Microsoft has provided a set of classes (Framework) called Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) for this very problem.WIF allows developers to write their own Security Token Service (STS) and / or Relying Party (RP).</p>
