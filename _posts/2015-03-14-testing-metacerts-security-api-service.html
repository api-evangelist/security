<p>Earlier this week I was contacted by folks at MetaCert.They provide an API that performs URL reputation checking.Basically, given a URL, it can report on possible issues with the content at that URL.Desktop browsers can help block URLs that lead to known malware (or other dangerous) sites, but mobile browsers don’t typically have that protection.Heck, you can’t even typically see the URL of a link when viewing web-based content in mobile apps.</p>
