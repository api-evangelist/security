<p>My colleague Sivakanth Mundru sent another guest post my way!This one shows you how to look up AWS API activity using CloudTrail.— Jeff;
As you know, AWS CloudTrail captures API activity that is made on your AWS account and delivers log files containing API activity to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket and a CloudWatch Logs log group that you specify.Today, we are announcing support for looking up API activity using the CloudTrail Console, AWS SDKs, and AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).You can now more easily troubleshoot operational issues or analyze potential security incidents.</p>
