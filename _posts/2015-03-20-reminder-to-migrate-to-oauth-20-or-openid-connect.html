<p>Over the past few years, we’ve publicized that ClientLogin, OAuth 1.0 (3LO) 1, AuthSub, and OpenID 2.0 were deprecated and would shut down on April 20, 2015.We’re moving away from these older protocols in order to focus support on the latest Internet standards, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which increase security and reduce complexity for developers.</p>
