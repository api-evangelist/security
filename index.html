<p>Security is an area I've been tracking on for a while, but only recently have locked in as a specific research area, allowing me to dig deeper, and develop my awareness of security and APIs.</p>

<p>I do not claim to be a security expert, I am far from it. What I will do is start by identifying the key stories, then the key players in the space. After that who knows. There is no doubt the security conversation is only going to escalate in the future, so I have to start establish my awarness and order now.</p>

<p>Ultimately I will look to my security contacts in the space to help educate me. So if you know of anything I should be looking add, feel free to send my way. </p>
